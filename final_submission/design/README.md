# Major Ideas

##### Our main design goal was to keep the app clean and minimalist, with the map and post feed centered on the page in separate containers and a simple black, white, and grey color scheme that lets the colorful map stand out. Early on, we had a “Filter By” menu with different filter options next to the feed, but we removed it to reduce clutter—since the map already shows how many posts each building has, it naturally works as a filter. We also focused on giving users options by letting them either explore posts through the interactive map or scroll through the feed, depending on their preference. Throughout the design process, we made sure to prioritize user engagement and accurate representation of public opinion by building in upvote/downvote functionality with a one-vote limit per user (with the option to undo), so that campus leadership can easily identify which issues matter most and where they’re happening. Finally, one late addition to our design was a “Help” page. This was an extremely important addition to our design, since an app is only useful to a user if they can understand how to navigate it, and we realized that we could not make any assumptions about our users’ ability to understand/navigate our app.
