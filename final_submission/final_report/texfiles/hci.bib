	abstract = {This paper considers the social value of anonymity in online university student communities, through the presentation of research which tracked the final year of life of the social media application Yik Yak. Yik Yak was an anonymous, geosocial mobile application launched in 2013 which, at its peak in 2014, was used by around two million students in the US and UK. The research we report here is significant as a mixed method study tracing the final year of the life of this app in a large UK university between 2016 and 2017. The paper uses computational and ethnographic methods to understand what might be at stake in the loss of anonymity within university student communities in a datafied society. Countering the most common argument made against online anonymity – its association with hate speech and victimisation – the paper draws on recent conceptual work on the social value of anonymity to argue that anonymity online in this context had significant value for the communities that use it. This study of a now-lost social network constitutes a valuable portrait by which we might better understand our current predicament in relation to anonymity, its perceived value and its growing impossibility.},

	abstract = {Participatory sensor network (PSN) enables the understanding of city dynamics and the urban behavioral patterns of their inhabitants. In this work, we focus our analysis on a speciﬁc PSN, derived from Waze, for sensing trafﬁc conditions. Our objective is to characterize the properties of this PSN, its broad and global spatial coverage as well as its limitations. We also bring discussions on different opportunities for application design using this network. We claim that the PSN derived from Waze has the potential to help us in the better understanding of trafﬁc problem reasons. Besides that, it could be useful for improving algorithms used in navigation services: (1) by exploiting the provided real-time trafﬁc information or (2) by helping in the identiﬁcation of valuable pieces of information that are hard to detect with traditional sensors, such as car accidents and potholes.},

SeeClickFix.com (SCF) is a web-based service designed to help citizens report non-emergency issues in their neighborhood. The submissions can be submitted via a web interface, by iPhone, Blackberry and Android reporting apps and a Facebook application. Local government officials receive alerts about submitted issues or can track issues that citizens submitted via the so-called 'Watch Area' they are responsible for. The platform allows for direct feedback mechanisms: Local government officials assign a work order number and can change the status of the repair (from open, in progress, to fixed). Citizens are automatically informed about changes in the status of their reported issues allowing for a full feedback cycle. The service is integrated into the social networking services Twitter and Facebook and provides map-based reporting widgets for government and newspaper websites.},
